📈 Stock News Headline Analysis

A machine learning project that analyzes stock market-related news headlines to uncover sentiment trends, correlations with stock price movements, and predictive insights.

🚀 Project Overview

This project explores how financial news headlines impact stock prices by:

Collecting news data related to specific tickers

Preprocessing textual data for analysis

Extracting sentiment and keyword features

Evaluating predictive models on stock movement

It aims to support informed trading decisions and enhance understanding of market behavior through NLP and sentiment analysis.

🧰 Tech Stack

Python: Core language

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation

NLTK / spaCy / TextBlob: Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis

Scikit-learn: Model training and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization

Yahoo Finance API / News API: Data sourcing

📊 Features

Scrapes real-time and historical headlines based on selected tickers

Cleans and tokenizes text data

Performs sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative)

Links headlines to corresponding stock movement data

Trains models to predict price movement based on headline sentiment

🧪 Model Techniques
Naive_Bayes

Random Forest

Optional enhancements could include:

Feature engineering with TF-IDF or word embeddings

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
